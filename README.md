# HIPAA Audit Protocol Table

HIPAA has made its audit protocol public, but has not yet made it exportable, or even very readable. I isolated the table that can be found on http://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/compliance-enforcement/audit/protocol/ and created an html file of the table and a csv version of the table, so it can be viewed as a spreadsheet. This has saved me a lot of stress, so wanted to post. I hope it is helpful to others!
